> **Note:** This package is currently in development and does not follow semver. Instead of using tilde/caret version (e.g. `~0.5.0`, `^0.5.0`), pin against an exact version (e.g. `0.5.0`).

This is the dependency package for [sharo][sharo] boilerplate, just like `react-scripts` in
`create-react-app`. I create this to make maintenance of my Node.js apps easier (simply update a
single package).

## Usage

Please refer to [sharo][sharo] for detailed documentations, usage, and examples.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcomed but should be limited to code maintenance, bugfixes, or
dependency updates. For feature requests, please send it at [sharo][sharo] instead.
